/*
 * GRUB is called from U-Boot as a Linux Kernel type image, which
 * means among other things that it always enters in ARM state.
 *
 *
 * Overview of GRUB image layout:
 *
 * _start:
 *              Entry point (1 ARM branch instruction, to "codestart")
 * grub_total_module_size:
 *              Data field: Size of included module blob
 *              (when generated by grub-mkimage)
 * codestart:
 *              Remainder of statically-linked executable code and data.
 * __bss_start:
 *              Start of included module blob.
 *              Also where global/static variables are located.
 * _end:
 *              End of bss region (but not necessarily module blob).
 * <overflow>:
 *              Any part of the module blob that extends beyond _end.
 * <modules>:
 *              Loadable modules, post relocation.
 * <stack>:     
 * <heap>:
